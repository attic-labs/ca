<h1>Noms Individual Contributor Agreement</h1>

<p>Thank you for your interest in the Noms open source project being administered by Attic Labs, LLC.

<p>Like many open source projects, we need a contributor agreement from you before we can accept your changes. You only need to fill out this agreement once.

<p>In brief, by submitting your code to Noms, you are granting us copyright of that work. You are also certifying that you wrote it, and that you are allowed to license it to us. In return, we grant you a license back to that code to use it for any purpose.

<p>Contributor Agreements are important because they define the chain of ownership of a piece of software. Some companies won't allow the use of free software without clear agreements around code ownership. That's why many open source projects collect similar agreements from contributors.

<p>Please read this document carefully before signing and keep a copy for your records. If you have questions about these terms, or if you cannot submit an electronic copy, please contact us at legal@attic.io.

<h2>The Agreement</h2>

<p>You accept and agree to the following terms and conditions for Your present and future Contributions submitted to Attic Labs.

<h3>1.	Definitions</h3>

<p><b>"You"</b> (or <b>"Your"</b>) shall mean the copyright owner or legal entity authorized by the copyright owner that is making this Agreement with Attic Labs. For legal entities, the entity making a Contribution and all other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that entity are considered to be a single Contributor. For the purposes of this definition, <b>"control"</b> means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

<p><b>"Contribution"</b> shall mean the code, documentation or any original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that is intentionally submitted by You to Attic Labs for inclusion in, or documentation of, any of the products owned or managed by Attic Labs (the <b>"Work"</b>). For the purposes of this definition, <b>"submitted"</b> means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to Attic Labs or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, Attic Labs for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by You as "Not a Contribution."

If any entity institutes patent litigation against You or any other entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that your Contribution, or the Work to which you have contributed, constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to that entity under this Agreement for that Contribution or Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
